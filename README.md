# Encrypt Tool CLI

This module provides a simple command-line interface for secure file encryption
and decryption using AES-128 in OCB mode. Users can create text files, encrypt
them with authenticated encryption, decrypt them with integrity verification,
and clean up working files.

All operations occur in a 'working/' directiory for isolated file handling.
